# Reduce to the Ridiculous
A calculator to determine if the cost of a piece of software/hardware is worth the purchase for your business.

Fill in the number of users who will be impacted by the software, the estimated cost of the software, the timeframe you want to look at, and the average wage of a full time employee (FTE). There is also a slider to let you choose just how much more efficient your employees will be after the purchase.

For example, if the software you are purchasing is made to make a task completed more efficiently, estimate how long it should take. If something takes an employee 5 minutes (300 seconds), and the software allows them to get that done in 4:30 (30 second decrease), you can say they had a 10% efficiency gain. For Document Management Software, 27% is about average and 10% is a conservative estimate.
